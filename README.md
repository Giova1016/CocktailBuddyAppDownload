## Introduction

This is a project made for a computer engineering course. The project's purpose was to create a working GUI for the idea we came up with during our course, a Mocktail application for mobile devices.
This project helped us learn how to create a working GUI and integrate SQLite databases to improve it further.

## Features

In this project, users may:
- Register and log in with their saved credentials.
- Select their desired preferences from a list of mocktail flavors along with levels of preferred sweetness/bitterness.

## Installation

To install the project you can follow this guide:
- First, I recommend you change the directory you would like to clone this repository, preferably an easy-to-access one.
- This can be done very easily, just like the following examples:

In a machine with Linux you can go to the terminal and type: 

```
cd path-to-the-directory
```

In a machine with Windows you can go to your command prompt and type

```
dir path-to-the-directory
```
- Next, make a Python virtual environment with the following command.

```
python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
```

- Here is an example of what it would look like if you were to do it on a Linux machine and make a new directory.

```bash
cd Desktop
mkdir project
cd project
python3 -m venv env
```

- Next, you can copy and paste the following commands into your terminal in the same order they are written.
- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Giova1016/CocktailBuddyAppDownload.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd CocktailbuddyApp
```

- Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing
I want to thank my friend @Omar-Torres11 for helping me write some of the code for this project. You were an amazing help during the time we spent making this GUI.
