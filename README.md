## Introduction

This is a project for a computer engineering course. The purpose for the project was to create a working GUI for the idea we came up with during our course.
This project helped us learn how to create a working GUI and integrate SQLite databases to improve it further.

## Features

In this project, users may:
- Register and log in with their saved credentials.
- Select their desired preferences from a list of mocktail flavors along with levels of preferred sweetness/bitterness.

## Installation

To install the project you can follow this guide:
- First, I recommend you change the directory you would like to clone this repository, preferably an easy-to-access one.
- This can be done with a simple cd path-to-the-directory or dir path-to-the-directory.
- Next, you can copy and paste the following commands into your terminal in the same order they are written.
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Giova1016/CocktailBuddyAppDownload.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd CocktailbuddyApp
```
